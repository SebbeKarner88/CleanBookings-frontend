In such cases, the length of the storage period of your personal data is specified in the applicable law. For example, the Accounting Act requires us to store documents and other accounting documents for at least six years from the end of the year in which the accounting year ended.

If you have given us your consent to receive marketing, we will store, for as long as we have a valid consent, certain information such as your name, email address and telephone number, which is transferred to our marketing register, even if your customer relationship with us has ended.

If you have refused marketing, we will store information about your refusal and your necessary personal data to ensure that we comply with your decision.
